# Subgraph

A Visual Effect Subgraph is an Asset that contains a part of a Visual Effect Graph that can be used in another Visual Effect Graph or Subgraph. Subgraphs can be used in graphs as three main usages:

* **System Subgraph** :  One, or many Systems contained into one Graph
* **Block Subgraph** : A set of blocks and operators packaged together and used as a Block
* **Operator Subgraph** : A set of operators packaged together and used as an Operator.

Subgraphs enable factorizing commonly used sets of nodes in a graph into reusable assets and adds them to the Library.
