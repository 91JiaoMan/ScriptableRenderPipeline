# Blocks

Blocks are Nodes that define the behavior of a [Context](Contexts.md). They are placed by the user and can be reordered in a Context Block Area. During the execution of the Effect Behavior they are executed from top to bottom.

Blocks can be used for many purposes, from simple value storage (for example, random Color) to high-level complex operations such as Noise Turbulence, Forces or Collisions.
