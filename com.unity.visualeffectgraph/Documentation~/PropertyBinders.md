# Property Binders

Property Binders are C# Behaviors you can attach to a GameObject with a [Visual Effect Component](VisualEffectComponent.md) : these behaviors enable making connections between scene or gameplay values and [Exposed Properties](Blackboard.md#exposed-properties-in-inspector) for this Visual Effect instance.

> For instance : a Sphere Binder can automatically set the position and the radius of a Sphere Exposed Property with the values of a sphere collider that is linked in the scene.
