# The Visual Effect Graph Window

The Visual Effect Graph Window is the main window of Visual Effect Graph, where users edit Visual Effect Graph assets, and subgraphs.  The window displays the workspace of systems, contexts and operators contained in a  [Visual Effect Graph Asset](VisualEffectGraphAsset.md).

## Opening the Visual Effect Graph Window

You can open the Visual Effect Graph Window using various methods:

* By Double-Clicking a  [Visual Effect Graph](VisualEffectGraphAsset.md) , or [SubGraph](VisualEffectGraphSubgraphAsset.md) Asset, or using the Open button in the Asset inspector.
* By clicking the Edit Button next to the Asset Template field in the [Visual Effect Inspector](VisualEffectComponent.md) (Doing so also connects the Target Visual Effect GameObject panel to this instance)
* From the Menu, by clicking Window / Visual Effects / Visual Effect Graph. Opening the window using this method will open an empty editor and require you to open an asset to start working on it.
