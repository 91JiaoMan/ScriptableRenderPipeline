# Spawner Callbacks

Spawner Callbacks is a C# API that enables defining custom runtime behavior and create new Blocks for use in Spawn Contexts.

<u>Spawner Callbacks enable you do the following:</u>

* Control the Spawn Context state (Playing, Stopped, Delayed)
* Read/Write the Output Spawn Count
